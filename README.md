$-----User Onboarding and Authentication
When launching Foodify, users are guided through three onboarding screens that introduce the app’s key features. To access the app, users must log in using their email and password. Google and Facebook login options are also available in the sign in page.

$-----Main Interfaces and Navigation
Once logged in, users go to the Home Page, which serves as the central hub. A navigation bar allows easy access to four additional key sections:

1.	Home Page – Browse, search, and discover a variety of recipes shared by the community.
2.	Add Recipe – Chefs can contribute their recipes by filling in details like title, ingredients, direction, time, and images. A dedicated add icon on the main interface makes this process quick and simple.
3.	Notifications – Users receive important updates, including recipe recommendations, alerts, and follower activity.
4.	Profile – Displays user or chef details, uploaded recipe count, follower count, and following count. Chefs can manage their recipes and track their community growth.
